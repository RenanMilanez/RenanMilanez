I am a Computer Science student, studying the 5th period, with strong knowledge and skills in MySQL, JAVASCRIPT, CSS and knowledge of Windows, and basic knowledge of Linux. Still looking for an opportunity as a developer and willing to learn new technologies and improve my skills, and other types of languages.

I'm looking for my first internship/job, in the data area, in front-end or back-end, to be able to evolve my knowledge and seek to contribute to a productive environment. Currently my strong point has been MySQL, HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
